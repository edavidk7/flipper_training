    "problem rather than re-inventing the wheel every time you want to train a policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For completeness, here is a brief overview of what the loss computes, even though\n",
    "this is taken care of by our :class:`~torchrl.objectives.ClipPPOLoss` module—the algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. we will sample a batch of data by playing the\n",
    "   policy in the environment for a given number of steps.\n",
    "2. Then, we will perform a given number of optimization steps with random sub-samples of this batch using\n",
    "   a clipped version of the REINFORCE loss.\n",
    "3. The clipping will put a pessimistic bound on our loss: lower return estimates will\n",
    "   be favored compared to higher ones.\n",
    "   The precise formula of the loss is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}L(s,a,\\theta*k,\\theta) = \\min\\left(\n",
    "\\frac{\\pi*{\\theta}(a|s)}{\\pi*{\\theta_k}(a|s)} A^{\\pi*{\\theta*k}}(s,a), \\;\\;\n",

    "we simply compute an importance-weighted version of the REINFORCE loss (for example, a\n",
    "REINFORCE loss that we have corrected for the fact that the current policy\n",
    "configuration lags the one that was used for the data collection).\n",
    "The second part of that minimum operator is a similar loss where we have clipped\n",
    "the ratios when they exceeded or were below a given pair of thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This loss ensures that whether the advantage is positive or negative, policy\n",
    "updates that would produce significant shifts from the previous configuration\n",
    "are being discouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we will define a set of hyperparameters we will be using for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, we will focus on creating our environment, or simulator, using TorchRL's\n",
    "   wrappers and transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, we will design the policy network and the value model,\n",
    "   which is indispensable to the loss function. These modules will be used\n",
    "   to configure our loss module.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Next, we will create the replay buffer and data loader.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, we will run our training loop and analyze the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we'll be using the :mod:`tensordict` library.\n",
    ":class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` is the lingua franca of TorchRL: it helps us abstract\n",

    "Also the `device` argument: for gym, this only controls the device where\n",

    "approach, more similar to other pytorch domain libraries, through the use of transforms.\n",

    "match a unit Gaussian distribution: to obtain this, we will\n",
    "run a certain number of random steps in the environment and compute\n",
    "the summary statistics of these observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll append two other transforms: the :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.DoubleToFloat` transform will\n",
    "convert double entries to single-precision numbers, ready to be read by the\n",
    "policy. The :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.StepCounter` transform will be used to count the steps before\n",
    "the environment is terminated. We will use this measure as a supplementary measure\n",
    "of performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see later, many of the TorchRL's classes rely on :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict`\n",
    "to communicate. You could think of it as a python dictionary with some extra\n",
    "tensor features. In practice, this means that many modules we will be working\n",
    "with need to be told what key to read (`in_keys`) and what key to write\n",
    "(`out_keys`) in the `tensordict` they will receive. Usually, if `out_keys`\n",
    "is omitted, it is assumed that the `in_keys` entries will be updated\n",
    "in-place. For our transforms, the only entry we are interested in is referred\n",
